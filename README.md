# Black Hole Image Simulator

## Description
This project is a **Black Hole Image Simulator** that visualizes gravitational lensing and accretion disk effects using Python and Pygame. The simulation models how light bends around a black hole and includes a dynamically colored accretion disk that exhibits **Doppler shifting**.

## Features
- **Light Bending Simulation**: Uses ray tracing to visualize gravitational lensing.
- **Accretion Disk Rendering**: Displays a rotating disk of particles with Doppler shifting (redshift/blueshift effects).
- **Real-time Adjustments**: Modify the black hole's mass and see how it affects gravitational lensing.
- **Pygame-Based Visualization**: Interactive window for dynamic simulation.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlackHoleSimulator.git
   cd BlackHoleSimulator
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux  
   venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows  
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the simulator
   ```sh
   python main.py
## Usage
- **Up/Down Arrow Keys**: Increase or decrease black hole mass.
- **Observe Light Paths**: Watch how light bends near the event horizon.
- **Accretion Disk Colors**: Experience relativistic Doppler shifting.

## Roadmap
- ðŸ”„ **Animate accretion disk rotation**
- ðŸŽ¥ **Implement a 3D camera movement system**
- ðŸ”¥ **Enhance rendering using OpenGL or shaders**
